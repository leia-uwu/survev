# Open sourced surviv.io

Survev.io is an open source recreation of a hit web game "surviv.io" that has been permanently shut down.

Our goal is to immortalize it by getting the recreation as close as possible to the last canonical version of the game.

We do not consider any updates after the Kongregate acquisition canonical, so those will not be a part of the project.

## Running locally

start client development server with `pnpm dev:client`

and server with `pnpm dev:server`

or cd into server and client directories and run `pnpm dev` for each

### Additional steps for accounts

Accounts are optional, set `accountsEnabled` to false in config.ts to disable them.
If disabled, you can skip the steps below.

First generate a private key and set encryptLoadoutSecret to it, this is used to encrypt loadouts.

```sh
openssl rand -base64 10
```

After that, you need to create and populate the PostgreSQL database and apply the database schema.

After [installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), start the service and create a database:

```bash
sudo -u postgres initdb --locale=C.UTF-8 --encoding=UTF8 -D /var/lib/postgres/data --data-checksums

systemctl enable --now postgresql.service

sudo -u postgres createuser survev
sudo -u postgres createdb survev -O survev
```

Then populate the database with the schema:

```bash

 cd server
 
 # run this everytime you make changes to the schema.ts
 pnpm run db:generate
 pnpm run db:migrate

 # start the server
 pnpm run dev
 # or
 # pnpm run dev:api
 # pnpm run dev:game
```

to interact with the database through an interface

```bash
 pnpm run db:studio 
```

to wipe the db and start over run, useful when messing up things
DO NOT RUN THIS IN PRODUCTION

```bash
 # set database permissions
 sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER survev WITH PASSWORD 'survev';"
 pnpm run db:wipe
```

### Additional steps for caching

Caching is disabled by default, set cachingEnabled to true in config.ts to enable it.

First install redis:

```sh
sudo apt install redis-server
```

Ensure Redis starts on boot and is running:

```sh
systemctl enable --now redis-server
```
